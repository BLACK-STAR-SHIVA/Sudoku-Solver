This is a demo project which can solve a sudoku of size 9X9 easily.
Developed a Java-based Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve puzzles.
Implemented and optimized a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for accurate Sudoku puzzle resolution.
Enhanced code readability and maintainability through clean coding practices and comprehensive documentation.
Identified and corrected logical errors in the algorithm to improve accuracy and performance.
Demonstrated strong problem-solving and analytical skills by debugging and optimizing the solver for various test cases
